  iPhone's are not for me. I want to just stick with Android phones as i personally
  think you can do more on Android phones and i really don't like Apple as a

  for sale. Check my feedback for testament to that. Naturally, the laptop will
  come free of icloud and ready for you to set up as your own. I hope I've managed to
  show everything that's relevant in my pictures. But if you still have any questions
